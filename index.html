					<h2>Software Engineer / Developer</h2>
					<p>
					Aiight? I see you've stumbled across my slice of the web. I knocked this up in the space of a morning as my old site was a little erm... dated. So please forgive any issues or oversights with the functionality, unless of course you're using a browser thats over a decade old, in which case this site and most of the internet probably sucks for you.
					</p>
					<p>
					So a little more about me, I'm a fairly recent graduate of Software Engineering, if two years can be considered recent? Ok I'm actually a not so recent graduate of De Montfort University in Leicester. I had a great time and learnt a lot about Software Engineering right from the basics of Computer Science through to methodologies for delivering software systems.

					<h2>Stuff that I studied...</h2>
					<p>
					This section used to be a complete list of the modules I studied at University but I think the technologies and practices involved makes for more interesting reading so here they are:
					GNU C, C++, HTML, XML, XSLT, MATLAB, SQL, Z Specification, JSP, MySQL, Java (SE, EJB, JPA), JBoss, Hibernate, PHP 5, Fuzzy Logic &amp; AI, TDD, Rigourous Systems, Ruby, Javascript.

					<h2>Where I've worked...</h2>
					<p>Whilst at university I was fortunate enough to undertake a placement year in industry which gave me a great insight into the way a real software house operates. I worked for a great company in the East Midlands called Exel, who produced and maintain an Enterprise Management System. Seriously this thing (EFACS E/8 to give it its full name) handled everything from payroll and stock levels, to bills of materials for manufacture, field service agent planning and tracking, goods inbound and outbound, purchasing and invoicing and a whole heap more. I worked primarily on resolving support tickets and delivering small pieces of custom functionality. This position gave me an opportunity to learn not only how to <em>talk</em> to computers (read as code in Java) but how to talk to less than technical clients about them and the nature of the problems there were facing.

					<h2>Where I'm working...</h2>
					<p>
					These days I'm lucky enough to be on the Engineering team at Jadu in Leicester, we deliver enterprise grade content management, forms, web and mobile solutions as well as first class product support, which is where I currently fit in. My day to day duties involve triaging inbound tickets, trying to explain technical issues to non-technical people and fixing and improving the code base. Since I've started working for Jadu I've improved my skills in PHP, Javascript, HTML and CSS.

					<h2>Other stuff I'm doing...</h2>
					<p>
					I'm often working on various proofs of concepts, trying out new technologies and tools. At the moment I'm trying to focus on improving my front end development skills using tools such as git, grunt and sass / less to create streamlined workflows. I'm also working on picking up some python and some ruby skills, as I've not used them too much before outside of university projects.
					</p>
					<p>
					I've been working on an API driven diretory service for listing organisations and businesses in Leicester, which hopefully will be completed sometime before the summer is over.
